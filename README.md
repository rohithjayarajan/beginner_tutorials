## Dependencies

### ROS

[ROS][reference-id-for-ROS] The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible 
framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify 
the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.
This package is developed and tested in ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and needs ROS Kinetic Kame installed for use. 
The entire installation instructions for ROS Kinetic Kame and its dependencies can be found [here][reference-id-for-ROS Kinetic].

[reference-id-for-ROS Kinetic]: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic
[reference-id-for-ROS]: http://www.ros.org/install/

### catkin

Catkin is included by default when ROS is installed. Catkin can also be installed from source or prebuilt packages. 
Most users will want to use the prebuilt packages, but installing it from source is also quite simple. Installation 
instructions can be found [here][reference-id-for-catkin]

[reference-id-for-catkin]: http://wiki.ros.org/catkin

### Package Dependencies
- roscpp
- rospy
- std_msgs

## Build Instructions

### Creating catkin workspace:
Follow the below comamnds to create a catkin workspace
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```
The above commands will create a workspace for your packages with CMakeLists.txt link in the src folder of catkin_ws. 
Source the setup.*sh file: 
```
source devel/setup.bash
```
### Building package inside catkin workspace: 
Follow the below comamnds and clone this package in the src folder of the catkin workspace 
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/rohithjayarajan/beginner_tutorials.git
```
Follow the below comamnds to build the package
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
catkin_make
```

## Run Instructions

Follow the below commands in the terminal to run both talker and listener using the launch file created (frequency of publishing can be modified here. Default=20):
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials talk_and_listen.launch frequency:=<value_of_publishing_rate_type_double>
```

Follow the below comamnds in the terminal to run talker and listener separately:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roscore
```

In a new terminal, follow the below command to run only the publisher (frequency of publishing can be modified here. Default=20):
```
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials talker <value_of_publishing_rate_type_double>
```

This will produce an output similar to the below:
```

```

In a new terminal, follow the below command to run only the subscriber:
```
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials listener
```
This will produce an output similar to the below:
```

## Service

Once both nodes are running in the background using either the roslaunch or rosrun method, in a new terminal, follow the below command to call the service (enter the custom string in double quotes):
```
source devel/setup.bash
rosservice call /change_string "<custom_string>"
```

When given custom string "giant leap for mankind" using a service call, an output similar to the below is produced in talker:
```

## Logging

Once both nodes are running in the background using either the roslaunch or rosrun method, to visualize the logger messages in a GUI, in a new terminal follow the below commands

```
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun rqt_console rqt_console
```

Once both nodes are running in the background using either the roslaunch or rosrun method, to visualize logger_level GUI, in a new terminal follow the below commands

```
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun rqt_logger_level rqt_logger_level
```

Kill the above three processes by pressing CTRL+C in the aforementioned terminals where roscore and rosrun have been run.
Another way to kill the nodes is by running the below command in a new terminal

```
rosnode kill [node_name]
```
